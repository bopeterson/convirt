   <h3>Virtual conferencing to promote research and scholarly exchange during the current pandemic and possible future disruptions </h3>
    <h4>Project description</h4>
      <p>
          In this pilot project researchers at Malm√∂ University and Georgia Tech conduct preliminary research, design and tests to examine the role for virtual and mixed reality (VR/MR) conferencing and academic meetings within a hybrid virtual conferencing environment. In comparison with traditional video conferencing, VR/MR conferencing has a number of unique characteristics e.g. spatial presence and embodied interaction. The pilot project explores the strengths and limitations in virtual and mixed media platforms.
